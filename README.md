# 🧠 TheQuizApp

A fully functional **Quiz App** built using **MVVM architecture**, **Retrofit**, and a **MySQL backend**. This app dynamically fetches quiz questions from a remote server, displays them one-by-one, and shows the final result based on user answers.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Fetches real-time quiz questions from MySQL backend using Retrofit
- ✅ Option selection with next/submit button flow
- 📊 Score/result shown at the end of the quiz
- 📲 Clean UI using Data Binding
- 🧠 Built on MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns
- 🔐 Secure API integration
- 🌐 Uses GSON for JSON parsing and model generation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer         | Tools & Technologies |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Architecture  | MVVM                |
| Networking    | Retrofit, GSON      |
| Backend       | MySQL, PHP API      |
| UI            | XML, Data Binding   |
| Language      | Java                |
| State Handling| LiveData, ViewModel |
| API Parsing   | @SerializedName, @Expose |

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The backend (MySQL + PHP) provides a RESTful API endpoint that returns quiz questions in JSON format.
2. Retrofit is used to make network requests and get the JSON response.
3. GSON parses the JSON into model classes.
4. ViewModel and Repository manage the logic and network layer.
5. The UI observes LiveData to display data dynamically and reflect the user's selections.
6. On completion, the app shows the final score based on correct answers.
